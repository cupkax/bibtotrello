  abstract = {The book Serious Moral Games illuminates a phenomenon widely discussed in the public realm from a new angle: the relationship between video games and morality. Instead of following the common line argument maintaining that the contents of video games rarely serve or even corrupt the understanding or promotion of moral actions, the authors consider the benefits these games might have to moral research and education. Could video games be useful instruments with which researchers can investigate the moral behavior of the players? Could these games even be a means for the players themselves to learn more about their own moral perceptions and values? Through analyses of common video games, the book Serious Moral Games contributes to the debate by demonstrating the potential that lies in these games, a potential that has thus far remained untapped. In addition to the use of games in moral research or as instruments for moral feedback, various other possible applications can be identified as well. Thus, this book can also be understood as an impetus to put into question the typical way of connecting video games and morality in terms of the danger the former poses to the latter. The unilateral approach should open up new possibilities for mutually beneficial interdisciplinary collaboration between moral researchers and game designers.},

We explore how players ``rehearse their ethos'' through gameplay and how they are continually pushing back against the magic circle.

It illustrates that there are no clear-cut answers\textemdash game structures, including nar- ratives, character designs, length, or save systems, can push players to act in certain ways that may or may not align with their belief and goals.},

Rather than a formal analysis of the game, our objective was to situate the research in game production studies by documenting the design context (gamework) and designer perceptions about the game that inform morally complex gameplay. The research was conducted with four team members of 11 bit studios: a senior game designer, a writer, a senior writer (with stakes in marketing), and a quality assurance lead. We employed reflective interviewing techniques and visual methods to better understand how moral gameplay was designed. Our analysis illustrates the roles underlying narratives in the design process and balancing everyday work negotiations play in the design of moral gameplay, how a designer's research informs the vision to create emotional realism in the game, and the importance of a player-centered iterative design process to produce morally engaging gameplay.},

The model has been used to implement an adaptive educational interactive narrative system (AEINS). AEINS is an inquiry based edugame to support teaching ethics. The AEINS version presented in this paper targets students between the age of 8 and 11. The idea is centered around presenting and involving students in different moral dilemmas (called teaching moments) within which the Socratic Method is the used pedagogy in the teaching process. AEINS monitors and analyzes the students actions in order to provide an individualized story-path and an individualized learning process. The student is an active participant in the educational process and is able to interact with the edugame as a first person player. We claim that such interaction can help in developing new or deeper thoughts about different moral situations. Our aim is to contribute to the design of serious games and help raise awareness of ethics and citizenship in children.},

Cyber space is currently transitioning from a laissez-faire into a regulated area. Yet, there is a significant heterogeneity in terms of the strength of commitment in different states to regulation and governance of digital spaces. Therefore, it is important to explore why this heterogeneity exists. This article proposes that heterogeneity in the commitment to regulation and governance of cyber space between different nations stems from the fundamental cross-cultural differences in human values between countries. Using an example of cybersecurity, we show how the cultural value orientations theory maps onto national commitments to regulate and govern cybersecurity issues. We construct a theoretical framework linking human values with cybersecurity regulation and confirm the existence of this link empirically using the data from the international Schwartz Value Survey and the Global Cybersecurity Index.},

Part I provides an introduction to the field of ethics, philosophy and philosophy of science, three ethical frameworks - virtue ethics, utilitarian ethics and communitarian ethics - and the notion of ethical hacking. Part II applies these frameworks to particular issues within the field of cybersecurity, including privacy rights, intellectual property and piracy, surveillance, and cyberethics in relation to military affairs. The third part concludes by exploring current codes of ethics used in cybersecurity. The overall aims of the book are to:provide ethical frameworks to aid decision making;present the key ethical issues in relation to computer security;highlight the connection between values and beliefs and the professional code of ethics. The textbook also includes three different features to aid students: 'Going Deeper' provides background information on key individuals and concepts; 'Critical Issues' features contemporary case studies; and 'Applications' examine specific technologies or practices which raise ethical issues. The book will be of much interest to students of cybersecurity, cyberethics, hacking, surveillance studies, ethics and information science."--Provided by publisher.},

  abstract = {According to cognitive psychologists, moral decision-making is a dual-process phenomenon involving two types of cognitive processes: explicit reasoning and implicit intuition. Moral development involves training and integrating both types of cognitive processes through a mix of instruction, practice, and reflection. Serious games are an ideal platform for this kind of moral training, as they provide safe spaces for exploring difficult moral problems and practicing the skills necessary to resolve them. In this article, we present Morality Play, a model for the design of serious games for ethical expertise development based on the Integrative Ethical Education framework from moral psychology and the Lens of the Toy model for serious game design.},
